  <p>
    My name is Anton Sankov!
  </p>

  <p>
    I am an aspiring software developer, currently working at VMware Carbon Black.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started this blog to share my knowledge with other people.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can expect to find articles on various topics, mostly things I have encountered in my daily job,
    where I am currently focused on building a SaaS product for Kubernetes Security.
  </p>

  <p>
    This involves writing highly-scalable, distributed microservices in Go, which not only protect Kubernetes,
    but also run in Kubernetes themselves.
