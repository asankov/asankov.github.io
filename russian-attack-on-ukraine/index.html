These claims are echoed by Russian media, almost all of which are under state control (the ones that are not are being censored by the government).</p><p>To my Russian readers - my friends, your government, headed by Vladimir Putin is lying to you.

He is not, he is just a hungry for power lunatic, not better than the Nazis that he claims he is fighting now.</p><p>You are also victims in this situation. The West has imposed unprecedented sanctions on your country - western companies are pulling out of Russia, your banks are kicked out of the SWIFT system and your national currency the ruble is down in record numbers. All of this, because of a dictator that wants to rule the world.</p><p>I know that some of you may not realize the full extent of the situation yet, because of the media censorship in your country, that’s why I wrote this post.</p><p>Here are some sources you can use to get more info about the situation (provided they are not blocked by your country):</p><ul><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine</a></li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War</a></li><li><a href=https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-23-22/h_ec5f24d5accb8f8503aabdc63e3fd22d>https://edition.cnn.com/europe/live-news/ukraine-russia-news-02-23-22/h_ec5f24d5accb8f8503aabdc63e3fd22d</a></li><li><a href=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-authorises-military-operations-donbass-domestic-media-2022-02-24/>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-putin-authorises-military-operations-donbass-domestic-media-2022-02-24/</a></li></ul></div></main><footer class="bg-dark py-5 row d-print-none"><div class="container-fluid mx-sm-5"><div class=row><div class="col-6 col-sm-4 text-xs-center order-sm-2"><ul class="list-inline mb-0"><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="User mailing list" aria-label="User mailing list"><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=mailto:asankov96@gmail.com aria-label="User mailing list"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></a></li><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Twitter aria-label=Twitter><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://twitter.com/a_sankov aria-label=Twitter><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=GitHub aria-label=GitHub><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://github.com/asankov aria-label=GitHub><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a></li><li class="list-inline-item mx-2 h3" data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=LinkedIn aria-label=LinkedIn><a class=text-white target=_blank rel=noopener href=https://linkedin.com/in/asankov aria-label=LinkedIn><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li></ul></div><div class="col-6 col-sm-4 text-right text-xs-center order-sm-3"></div><div class="col-12 col-sm-4 text-center py-2 order-sm-2"><small class=text-white>&copy; 2023 Anton Sankov All Rights Reserved</small>
