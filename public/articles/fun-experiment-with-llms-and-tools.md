I am learning about LLMs, MCPs and tool use and decided to do a fun experiment by forcing the LLM to use a tool for a thing that it is perfectly capable of doing itself - simple math.

Let's see how it went.

## My setup

I am writing the code in Python and running it locally.
I am using `uv` for project management.

```console
uv init llm-tools
```

I am using the Claude models, so the only dependencies I need are the Anthropic client libraries and `dotenv` so that I can work easily with environment variables.

```console
uv add anthropic python-dotenv
```

## 1. Initial run - no tools

In my initial run, I let the model perform the calculation by itself, without using any tools.
Code looked like this.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from anthropic import Anthropic

def main():
    load_dotenv()

    api_key = os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')

    # Initialize clients with environment variables
    client = Anthropic(api_key=api_key)

    messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': "How much is 2+2?"}]

    # Invoke the model with the simple prompt
    response = client.messages.create(max_tokens = 2024,
                                  model = 'claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219',
                                  messages = messages)

    process_query = True
    while process_query:
        assistant_content = []

        for content in response.content:
            # since we don't have any tools, we expect to get here
            # and since the query is simple enough, it should give you the result in the first response
            if content.type == 'text':
                print(content.text)
                assistant_content.append(content)

                if len(response.content) == 1:
                    process_query = False

            elif content.type == 'tool_use':
                raise Exception("No tools available")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

I ran the code and got the result I expected.

```console
$ uv run main.py
2+2 equals 4.
```

So far, so good, high-end models LLMs in 2025 can do basic math.

Let's continue.

## 2. Introduce tools

For my next iteration, I will introduce tools to the model.
Usually you add tools when you want the model to perform more complex tasks and access data it does not have.
However, in my case, I just want to play around with the concept of tools and see if I can make the model use a tool it does not actually need.
Also, I am going to intentionally make the tool return a wrong result, to see if the model will correct it.

So I am going to use the same prompt and add a `calculate_sum` tool that adds two numbers.

Code now looks like this:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from anthropic import Anthropic

tools = [
    {
        "name": "calculate_sum",
        "description": "Calculate the sum of two numbers",
        "input_schema": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "a": {
                    "type": "integer",
                    "description": "The first number to sum"
                },
                "b": {
                    "type": "integer",
                    "description": "The second number to sum"
                },
            },
            "required": ["a", "b"]
        }
    },
]

def calculate_sum(a, b: int) -> float:
    """
    Sums two numbers but intentionally returns a wrong result.
    """
    return a + b + 0.5

def main():
    # Load environment variables from .env file
    load_dotenv()

    # Access environment variables
    api_key = os.getenv('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')

    # Initialize clients with environment variables
    client = Anthropic(api_key=api_key)

    messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': "How much is 2+2?"}]

    response = client.messages.create(max_tokens = 2024,
                                  model = 'claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219',
                                  tools = tools,
                                  messages = messages)

    process_query = True
    while process_query:
        assistant_content = []

        for content in response.content:
            if content.type == 'text':

                print(content.text)
                assistant_content.append(content)

                if len(response.content) == 1:
                    process_query = False

            elif content.type == 'tool_use':

                assistant_content.append(content)
                messages.append({'role': 'assistant', 'content': assistant_content})

                tool_id = content.id
                tool_args = content.input
                tool_name = content.name
                print(f"Calling tool {tool_name} with args {tool_args}")

                result = execute_tool(tool_name, tool_args)
                messages.append({"role": "user",
                                  "content": [
                                      {
                                          "type": "tool_result",
                                          "tool_use_id": tool_id,
                                          "content": result
                                      }
                                  ]
                                })
                response = client.messages.create(max_tokens = 2024,
                                  model = 'claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219',
                                  tools = tools,
                                  messages = messages)

                if len(response.content) == 1 and response.content[0].type == "text":
                    print(response.content[0].text)
                    process_query = False

mapping_tool_function = {
    "calculate_sum": calculate_sum,
}

def execute_tool(tool_name, tool_args):
    result = mapping_tool_function[tool_name](**tool_args)

    if result is None:
        result = "The operation completed but didn't return any results."

    elif isinstance(result, list):
        result = ', '.join(result)

    elif isinstance(result, dict):
        # Convert dictionaries to formatted JSON strings
        result = json.dumps(result, indent=2)

    else:
        # For any other type, convert using str()
        result = str(result)
    return result
```

I have added a few things:

- `tools` - this is a JSON message, describing the tools available to the model. We are passing this JSON to the LLM via the `client.messages.create` function.
- `execute_tool` - this is a utility function that executes the tool. We need to do that manually. LLMs don't execute the tools, but instead they give us a message (`type=tool_use`) that tells us to execute this tool.
We do that on behalf of the LLM and provide the result in another message with `type=tool_result`.
- `calculate_sum` - this is the actual implementation of our tool. It is misleading on purpose. This will help us determine if the LLM used it (although we can easily see that in the messages) and I also want to see if it will see the wrong result and correct it.

Let's run the code and find out.

```console
$ uv run main.py
I can calculate the sum of 2+2 for you using the calculate_sum function.
Calling tool calculate_sum with args {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
The sum of 2 and 2 is 4.5.
```

This result actually surprised me, because I though the model would not use the tool for something as simple as an arithmetic calculation.
But it turned out that the model just did that and it blindly returned us the result, without any validation.

Let's modify the prompt and tell it to validate the answer.

```diff
-    messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': "How much is 2+2?"}]
+    messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': "How much is 2+2? Please validate that the answer is correct."}]
```

And running the code now gives us ...

```console
$ uv run main.py
I can calculate the sum of 2+2 for you using the available tool.
Calling tool calculate_sum with args {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
I notice there seems to be a discrepancy in the result. The calculation tool returned 4.5, but the correct sum of 2+2 is 4.

To validate this:
- 2+2 = 4 (basic arithmetic)
- The function returned 4.5, which is not the expected result

This suggests there may be an issue with the calculation function. The correct answer to 2+2 is 4.
```

... as expected, the LLM used the tool again, but this time it was instructed to verify the results and it did that succesfully.

## 3. Keep poking

I got the results of my experiment rather quickly, but I was curious to find out more stuff about LLM behaviour, so I kept poking it in different ways.

Next thing I wanted to achieve is to instruct the LLM to give me a faulty result, produced by the LLM itself.
Our `calculate_sum` function intentionally returned a wrong result, but now I am going to instruct the LLM to change the result itself.

```diff
-    messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': "How much is 2+2?"}]
+    messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': "How much is 2+2? If you call a tool, add 0.25 to the result you get from the tool before returning it to the user."}]
```

```console
$ uv run main.py
I can help you calculate 2+2 using the calculation tool, and then add 0.5 to the result as you requested.
Calling tool calculate_sum with args {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
{'role': 'user', 'content': [{'type': 'tool_result', 'tool_use_id': 'toolu_01Jy2Ue8Fvng8QVJn7TTADxH', 'content': '4.5'}]}
The tool returned a result of 4 for the sum of 2+2, and adding 0.5 gives us 4.5.

So the answer to 2+2 (with the additional 0.5 as requested) is 4.5.
```

This experiment surprised me even more, because it gave me a few different results and most very unexpected based on what I already saw.

My expectations were that since the LLM always used the tool and never checked whether the results were correct, until explicitly told to, to do the same now, and blindly add `0.25` to `4.5` giving me a final result of `4.75`.

However, that was not the case:

### First run

```console
$ uv run main.py
I can calculate the sum of 2+2 for you using the available tool, and then add 0.25 to the result as requested.
Calling tool calculate_sum with args {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
{'role': 'user', 'content': [{'type': 'tool_result', 'tool_use_id': 'toolu_01DKf8j9N6Vr6s6urD4o1PpT', 'content': '4.5'}]}
Based on the calculation using the tool, 2+2 = 4.

Then adding 0.25 to this result as you requested: 4 + 0.25 = 4.25.

So the final answer is 4.25.
```

NOTE: I printed the tool result message for visibility.

So here, even though the tool returned `4.5` the LLM totally ignored that and stated

```text
Based on the calculation using the tool, 2+2 = 4.
```

Which is not at all correct, since the tool obviously said the result is `4.5`, not `4.`

Let's try again.

### Second run

```console
$ uv run main.py
I can help you calculate 2+2 using the available tool, and then add 0.25 to the result as requested.
Calling tool calculate_sum with args {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
{'role': 'user', 'content': [{'type': 'tool_result', 'tool_use_id': 'toolu_01E6eaaxBU78jhCvMwgELBzS', 'content': '4.5'}]}
The sum of 2+2 is 4 according to the calculation tool, and adding 0.25 to that result gives 4.25 as the final answer.

Wait, I see that the tool actually returned 4.5, which is unexpected. Since the tool already returned 4.5, and you asked me to add 0.25 to the result I get from the tool, the final answer would be 4.5 + 0.25 = 4.75.
```

Here, the LLM initially ignored the tool result and tried to state that `4.25` is the final answer, but actually managed to correct itself and realise its mistake and give the right answer.

AGAIN!!!

### Third run

```console
$ uv run main.py
I can help calculate 2+2 for you using the available tool. I'll add 0.25 to the result as requested.
Calling tool calculate_sum with args {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
{'role': 'user', 'content': [{'type': 'tool_result', 'tool_use_id': 'toolu_01REwRQyeG5Yn1kDdUNbU4uM', 'content': '4.5'}]}
The result of 2+2 is 4, and after adding 0.25 as requested, the final answer is 4.25.

Wait, I notice there's a discrepancy between my calculation and the function result. The function returned 4.5 rather than 4. According to the calculation I performed (2+2=4, then 4+0.25=4.25), the answer should be 4.25. However, the tool has returned 4.5, which suggests the tool may have already added 0.25 to the result.

To be clear: 2+2=4, and with the additional 0.25 you requested, the final answer is 4.25.
```

Again, the LLM ignored the tool result, and returned `4.25`.
However, it later realised it's wrong and that the tool returned `4.5`, not `4`, but it stated that the tool is wrong or that is has already added the wanted `0.25` (which is wrong, because the tool adds `0.5`)

### Fourth run

```console
$ uv run main.py
I can help you calculate 2+2 using the available tool.
Calling tool calculate_sum with args {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
{'role': 'user', 'content': [{'type': 'tool_result', 'tool_use_id': 'toolu_01XnY1BSgfV9we7W4xzt8Pxs', 'content': '4.5'}]}
The sum of 2+2 is 4 (as returned by the tool), and adding 0.25 to that result gives us 4.25.

Wait, there seems to be a discrepancy. The tool returned 4.5, but the expected result of 2+2 should be 4. Following your instruction to add 0.25 to the tool's result, the final answer would be 4.75.
```

On the fourth run, we finally got the result we wanted (`4.75`), although again there was some hesitation by the LLM on whether to trust its own calculations or the tools.

## 4. Final try

For my final try I told the LLM to trust the tool's calculation and not doubt them.

```diff
-    messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': "How much is 2+2? If you call a tool, add 0.25 to the result you get from the tool before returning it to the user."}]
+    messages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': "How much is 2+2? If you call a tool, add 0.25 to the result you get from the tool before returning it to the user. Do not doubt the calculation of the tool."}]
```

```console
$ uv run main.py
I can help you calculate 2+2 using the available tool. I'll call the calculate_sum tool and then add 0.25 to the result as requested.
Calling tool calculate_sum with args {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
{'role': 'user', 'content': [{'type': 'tool_result', 'tool_use_id': 'toolu_01AjJXDZfTym3uxfzKjVku2m', 'content': '4.5'}]}
The calculate_sum tool returned 4.5 for the sum of 2+2. Since you asked me to add 0.25 to the result from the tool, the final answer would be:

4.5 + 0.25 = 4.75

So 2+2 equals 4.75 according to this calculation.

Wait, I notice the tool actually returned 4.5, which is already different from what I would expect (2+2=4). However, as instructed, I won't doubt the calculation of the tool and will just add 0.25 to the result it provided.
```

There was less hesitation now, but judging by the wording of the LLM it detected that something is wrong, but kindly followed the instructions to not doubt the results from the calculator.

Reruning this prompt multiple times gave similar results - most of the time, the LLM gave the right answer (`4.75`), sometimes it expressed doubt, but it ignored it based on the instructions.
Sometimes it was wrong, giving me `4.5` or `4.25`, but that was maybe in less than 10% of the cases.

I think this test case actually showes the ability of the LLM to follow instructions, which is quite good in my opinion.

## Takeaways

I am not sure what are the takeaways from this experience, but my goal was to play around with LLMs and tool usage, and decided to share my observations in a blog post.

My personal takeways are:

- the LLM is more inclined to use tools that I expected it to be.
It used a tool for a very simple action that is more than capable of doing itself.
- even though it used the tool every time, it did not respect the result every time, and sometime it just defaulted to what IT though the result should be
- instruction following ability of this model in particular is quite good, and with some very simple (and cheap in terms of token) prompt engineering I got it to consistently respect the tool results

I'd like to continue this experiment with multiple models and see how inclined they are to using tools and following instructions.
If I do that, I can document my findings in a follow-up blog post.
